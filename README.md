# randompartitions
Uniform random sampling of partition, optionally with a fixed number of parts

This is a straighforward implementation of Arratia & DeSalvo's Algorithm 5 *Probabilistic Divide-and-Conquer Deterministic Second Half for Integer Partitions*, arXiv:1110.3856, together with DeSalvo's answer on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2161406/how-do-i-generate-a-uniform-random-integer-partition).
